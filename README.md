## 💼📈Portfolio-Project
This project encodes and decodes messages using basis vectors.


This project encodes and decodes messages using basis vectors. In simple terms, think of it as a way of transforming a message into a different 'language'—where each set of basis vectors represents a specific perspective or coordinate system. To decode the message, you need to have the appropriate 'translation'—the corresponding basis vectors from that same 'language.' 

While this project doesn't have much practical use, it serves as a portfolio piece to demonstrate my understanding of basis change, linear transformations, and mathematical concepts.



⚠️ Optimization Disclaimer
- "The code is intentionally not optimized for speed or compactness. The primary goal of this project is to clearly demonstrate the underlying mathema tical concepts and provide a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough of how basis change and linear transformations work. I prioritized readability and intuition over performance, as this project serves as a showcase of my understanding of these topics rather than a high-performance implementation."

🚦Limitations:
Only 1D/2D/3D basis vectors allowed - no zero or higher than 3D.



Rememeber to include
- each symbol is 1 Vector
- we pad Vectors (with PADIDNG SYMBOL = -1) only to allign shapes with basis vectors.
