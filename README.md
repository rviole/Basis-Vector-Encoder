## **üìñ Description**

This project demonstrates encoding and decoding messages using basis vectors. 
In simple terms, it transforms a message into a different 'language' where each set of basis vectors represents a specific perspective or coordinate system. To decode the message, you need the appropriate 'translation' - the corresponding basis vectors from that same 'language.' 

The project involves:
1. Mapping each symbol in a message to a vector using a predefined symbol mapping.
2. Encoding the message by transforming these vectors using a custom basis matrix.
3. Decoding the message by applying the inverse transformation to retrieve the original vectors and mapping them back to symbols.

| `main.py`                | Core encoding/decoding logic            |

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Disclaimer: This project is intentionally non-practical and serves as a showcase.

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the Symbol Mapping:**
   Ensure `symbol_mapping.json` contains the mappings for all symbols you want to encode.

2. **Encrypt a Message:**
   Use the `encrypt` function from `main.py` to encode a message. Provide the raw message, symbol mapping, and a basis matrix.
   ```python
   from main import encrypt
   import numpy as np
   import json

   with open("symbol_mapping.json", "r") as f:
       symbol_mapping = json.load(f)

   raw_message = "Hello, World!"
   basis_matrix = np.array([[1, 1], [1, -1]])
   encrypted_message = encrypt(raw_message, symbol_mapping, basis_matrix)
   ```

3. **Decrypt a Message:**
   Use the `decrypt` function from `main.py` to decode the message. Provide the encrypted message, the same basis matrix, and the symbol mapping.
   ```python
   from main import decrypt

   decrypted_message = decrypt(encrypted_message, symbol_mapping, basis_matrix)
   print("Decrypted message:", decrypted_message)
   ```


## üîß Workflow

So, how the code works? Here is a step by step explanation.

1. The goal of a file is to encode a string message in specific coordinate system (described by specific basis matrix). Then we decode the same encoded message, using basis representation of that coordinate system in another coordinate system (Jenifer's basis vectors represented using Mike's basis vectors)

2. To do all of the described operations, first we need to map each symbol to a vector in space. For this, we read `symbol_mapping.json` which is file that mapps each symbol/token to an integer.
It also contains `UNK` (Unkown Token) and `PAD` (Padding Token). Mapping symbols in vectors in such way implicitly makes them in std basis.
```json
{
    "UNK": -1,
    "PAD": 70,
    "a": 1,
    "b": 2,
    "c": 3,
    "d": 4,
    "e": 5,
    ...
    "\\": 65,
    "|": 66,
    "`": 67,
    "~": 68,
    " ": 69

}
```

3. We use `encrypt()` functions  to map each symbol. Then we pad it based on the dimensions of the basis matrix provided (2, 3, ...). Then we vectorize them using `Vector` class and transform using new basis matrix.

4. In `decrypt()` function, we pass the encrypted message along with the same basis represenation of the basis we used to encode the message. Note: We must pass to `decrypt()` function the same basis change representaion matrix as to `encrypt()` function. That transformation matrix says "Jenifer's basis vectors in Mike's perspective/ described by vectors in the Mike's coordinate system".

Additional Notes:

- In this implementation, each symbol in the string corresponds to a single vector.
- Vector() class is a simple overlay  of np.ndarray with just a simple shape manipulation and clarity in names
